<h2>FLAMANGO</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I think my game is fairly original because I made all of the image assets and I have never seen a game use flamingos and mangoes before.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I use a random number generator to generate the locations of all of the mangoes every time they are spawned on the screen.  I also calculated the box that they display in so that they don't overlap the info at the top of the screen.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned that it is a lot easier to make a game than I had originally thought.  The hardest part was finding some information about collecting the mangoes, but I ended up finding a way that worked out for me.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made all of the images within this game.  But I borrowed some assets such as the sounds and some of the code.
<ul>
<li>Coin Collecting Sound: https://freesound.org/people/TheDweebMan/sounds/277215/</li>
<li>EndGame Sound: https://freesound.org/people/Joykey/sounds/393385/</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
<li>Code That's not already referenced: https://phaser.io/examples</li>
<li>Specifically from the sprites and buttons. </li>
<li> I also borrowed the code to make the mangoes appear randomly from here:https://codepen.io/Samid737/pen/RLQBqM?editors=1010</li>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Flamango is an orange flamingo who really likes mangoes.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I'm not really sure what my theme is yet.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I used 4-way motion controls to control Flamango up and down and left and right across the screen to collect the mangoes.  You can pick up and 'collect' the mangoes, it adds points to your final score.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Collection, I suppose.  The more you collect, the more points you'll get in the end.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to have a fun and satisfying experience.  It's satisfying to clear the screen but when you do, more mangoes spawn and you just want to clear the screen again.  It's kind of relaxing.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player begins collecting mangoes as fast as possible in the time frame given.  The more mangoes the player collects, the higher their score.  After all the mangoes from the screen are cleared, more spawn and more are able to be collected to gain a higher score.  After the timer runs out, no more points can be collected and the game is over.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The mangoes spawn randomly, so sometimes they spawn in large groups and other times they spawn far away from each other.  The player must decide which ones to go for because if they have to travel further to collect the remaining mangoes, the timer may run out before they get to them.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Flamango is a flamingo in a world of Pink Flamingos.  He stands out and the Pink Flamingos make fun of him and his adoration of Mangoes.  So he will soon set off to find other orange Flamingos.  But first, he must collect food for his journey.  You want Flamango to have as much food as possible before he goes on his journey, but this doesn't necessarily create tension.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone can play this game, even children.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
It takes about 20 seconds to play every time the game is started.
