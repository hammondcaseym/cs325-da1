<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?/// My game is original because of the story and because I made some of the backgrounds (Main Menu, Loading Screen, and first Story Card, as well as the Shuriken!)
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
    The enemies track the player and move closer when the player gets within a certain radius.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?/// I like building upon older games in the area in which I did poorly.  In this case it was getting projectiles to work properly so I spent most of my time organizing a class that just handles the projectiles for me and tracks their hit boxes and when they are collided with an enemy.
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?//The easiest part was probably just loading in all of the sprites and animations.  Since my spritesheets all come from the same sprite-building site, they all have the same frame numbers for walk and attack animations, which is handy.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>

</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic.

You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
