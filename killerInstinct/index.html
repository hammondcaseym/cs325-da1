<h2>KILLER INSTINCT</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
All of the art within this game is completely original.  Any art within this game is made by me in Aesprite software.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I think that the technology of this game is interesting because most games nowadays are more focused on action and mashing buttons as quickly as possible.  Giving the player time to think about their questions and how it could make the suspects react is something that I think is unique.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned that having branching dialogue is a little more difficult than I had originally thought.  But I was finally able to do it and I think I am proud of the results.
The easiest part was probably making the assets.  I enjoy pixel art and I think I did a pretty good job of keeping it simple yet detailed enough to keep the player engaged.  The hardest part was definitely the branching dialogue and getting the story to play out correctly.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>All Art Assets: self-made</li>
<li>Music: source</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Another game that takes stress and interrogation into the same concept as I did, is <i>Detroit: Become Human</i> (Quantic Dream) for PS4.  My stress level indicator is very similar to the one they use in that game and I use it in a very similar way.
<ul>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Killer Instinct is a mystery/suspense game where the player finds and examines evidence from a crime scene, and uses that evidence to interrogate suspects and extract a confession.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Definitely Mystery/Suspense/Puzzle
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Point and Click concept was used for the crime scene phase.  The interrogation is mostly just button clicks.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Puzzle Solving and Deduction based on the evidence found.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to have a sense of actual detective work while playing.  The game is intentionally vague to make the player the one who has to think and come up with answers.  It is up to the player to ask the right questions in the right order in order to get the confession from the right suspect.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
<li>Crime Scene Phase:  the player will search around the crime scene and click on pieces of evidence to collect and examine.  When clicked, the evidence will enter a sort of EXAMINING mode in which a description of the evidence will be given.  If there is more to the evidence than what lies on the surface, there may be a [!] button under the EXAMINING window, in which the player can click and examine the evidence even further.  Most times, this will give the player an idea of why the evidence was found in a certain position and could give the player insight into who may have done the crime.
</li>
<li>Suspect Phase:  the player can select any suspect.  When the player rolls their mouse over the suspects, their information will appear at the bottom of the screen.  This information will be generic, telling the player their name, age, sex, and relationship with the victim.  It can also tell the player more in depth information, such as blood type and an image of their fingerprint pattern.  This could come in handy in selecting the right suspect right off the bat, or it may confuse the player into thinking the wrong suspect is the murderer.</li>
<li>Interrogation Phase:  the player will interrogate their selected suspect.  Pre-formatted questions will be given, and the player can select whichever approach they choose--passive or aggressive.  Either option can increase or decrease the stress level of the suspect.  If the stress level is boosted to an optimal range, the suspect may confess if they are the correct suspect.  The player can ask any suspect as many times as they wish, but if the correct suspect's stress level passes the optimal zone, they will call their laywer and the player will lose the game.  If they confess, the player will win the game.</li></li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
